# Weather WebApp

This project is a simple Weather Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a Node.js backend. The application allows users to search for a city and displays real-time weather information alongside a background image of the searched location.

## Features

Weather Search: Enter a city name to retrieve current weather conditions.

Dynamic Background: Displays a corresponding image of the searched location.

API Integration: Uses external APIs to fetch weather data and location images.

Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
